    "\n",
    "Now we'd like to do something a bit more systematic with our HH neuron, namely find the firing rate versus the amplitude of injected current. As we discussed briefly in class, there is a current below which the cell will never fire (the _rheobase_) but above that value the cell will fire and increase its firing rate as teh injected current increases. The question is what happens at the transition from not-firing to firing: does it smoothly rise from a firing rate of 0 or is there a sudden jump? This is a key distinction of the behavior of so-called Type I neurons and Type II neurons that goes along with many other important differences. "
