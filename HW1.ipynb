    "In class, i made the claim that out RC \"point neuron\" acts as a low pass filter where the membrane voltage / R tracks the injected current but only if the injected current changes slowly. In this problem you'll evaluate this claim by considering a sinusoidal injected current with a variable period, $T$. After finding the solution you'll determine what happens when the injected current changes slowly (i.e. $\\tau << T$) or quickly ($\\tau >> T$)\n",
